## Installing in other browsers
It is possible to install and use the Save to the Wayback Machine browser extension in browsers that do not have their own extension/add-on stores and are not officially supported by VerifiedJoseph.

### Opera

As of February 22, 2020, the browser extension can longer be downloaded from Opera's add-on store. To install the browser extension in Opera you must [install an extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) which allows you to use the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-the-wayback-machi/eebpioaailbjojmdbmlpomfgijnlcemk).

### Brave & Vivaldi

Both [Brave](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017909112-How-can-I-add-extensions-to-Brave-) and [Vivaldi](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/appearance-customization/extensions/#Installing_an_Extension_in_Vivaldi) support installing browser extensions directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-the-wayback-machi/eebpioaailbjojmdbmlpomfgijnlcemk). 

### Firefox Forks

The browser extension can be installed from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/save-to-the-wayback-machine/) in Firefox forks that support WebExtensions.
